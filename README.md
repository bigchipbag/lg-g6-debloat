This script debloats the stock rom "H87315c_00_OPEN_CA_OP_1026.kdz" which I often reflash to my G6
It's easier to just run a .bat file with all the stuff. 


USAGE:
Install the ADB tools from whatever source (lol)
Make sure your phone is set to developer mode, set to USB Debugging, and you've granted access to the computer (run adb shell once then approve on the phone)
Download the .bat file and run it in the same directory as adb.exe
Enjoy phone with less junk

Use at your own risk, idk. Implied no warranty
